quick play football on c64
1103.64 does not have a graphic user interface. It is a Commodore 64 quick play football score generator
I've spent time with the past several years. It prompts user for specific team scoring and defense data 
then will generate scoring events. 
Typically I'll use three events per quarter for the NFL and four for NCAA. Would work for high school as well.

Users are invited to make changes to the program code and share their work.
